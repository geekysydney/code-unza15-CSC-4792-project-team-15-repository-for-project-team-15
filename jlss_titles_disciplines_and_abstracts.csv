View of Some Novels are Novels While Others are Not: Carnivalesque and Contemporaneity in Dambudzo Marechera's House of Hunger,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1297/923,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1297/923,"ABSTRACT
This article aims at investigating whether or not there is novelness as defined 
by Bakhtin in Dambudzo Marechera’s House of Hunger. It focuses on Mikhail 
Bakhtin’s concepts of carnivalesque and contemporaneity in examining 
the quality of novelness in House of Hunger. Mikhail Bakhtin’s concept of 
novelness says that the novel has its own quality that differentiates it from 
other genres. It argues that this quality is realised through heteroglossia, 
carnivalesque, polyphony genre-absorption, and contemporaneity or contact 
with the present. Carnivalesque is the use of language of debasement, parody 
and travesty in sharing meaning. It also refers to parodying other genres, which 
is a key element in the novel. Contemporaneity refers to the novel’s contact 
with living memory in contrast with the epic which is related to glorification 
of the past that is largely not linked to the present circumstances of the time. 
After examination of the novel, it has been observed that it exhibits elements 
of carnivalesque as a criticism of both society and other literary genres. It 
has also been observed that issues shared in the novel are contemporary and, 
therefore, key to issues relating to the reading public. The article therefore 
concludes that, based on carnivalesque and contemporaneity, there are 
elements of novelness in Dambudzo Marechera’s House of Hunger. For that 
reason, House of Hunger is a novel."
View of Contradictions of a Society in Transition: A Look at Henry Musenge's Novel Changing Shadows,Sociology,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1298/924,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1298/924,"ABSTRACT
This article seeks to highlight the contradictions that characterise the society 
in transition as regards cultural change. It focuses on Henry Musenge’s novel 
Changing Shadows, which depicts a people in a dilemma with regard to the 
appropriate culture between the traditional ethnic culture and the new modern 
culture. Some members in this society wish to adhere to tradition and at the 
same time attempt to demonise the new emerging culture. On the opposite 
extreme end, others regard the traditional culture as backward and outdated; 
one that should be disposed of completely, and eagerly wish to embrace the 
new modern culture. Still, others wish to embrace both cultures – or the hybrid 
of both cultures. The contradiction lies in the fact that on one hand there is a 
(national) call to uphold (selected) traditional values and practices as these are 
said to enforce national identity and national pride. On the other hand, there is 
a ‘public’ call for change and a call to embrace the new modern culture; thus, 
‘tradition is good’ versus ‘tradition is bad, evil, retrogressive and outdated’. 
This bi-polar approach to culture happens in one society and consequently 
degenerates into internal divides in the same society. The challenge is that 
these two cultures, in many respects, tend to be mutually exclusive; the 
practices are conflicting. This calls for the need for society to revisit and guide 
properly seeing that the ambivalent/dual-structured cultural disposition creates 
confusion and contradictions. This article is largely guided by the sociological 
approach which posits that literature should serve as a mirror of society and to 
provide solutions for society. However, it is also guided by theories composed 
in cultural studies and multiculturalism."
View of Unravelling the Complexity of Cinyanja Compound Words: A Distributed Morphology Approach,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1299/925,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1299/925,"ABSTRACT
Compound words are found in most languages and play an essential 
role in the lexicon of the majority of languages because they reflect 
the interface between morphology, phonology, syntax and semantics. 
The present study seeks to provide a broader analysis of Cinyanja VN-
compound words with a non-derived noun in the nominal position 
based on Distributed Morphology framework provided by Halle and 
Marantz (1993). Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to show the 
intricate processes involved in the formation and interpretation of 
compound words. The data used in this study were mainly collected 
from secondary sources which included written sources in Cinyanja. 
The findings of the study arising from the syntactic analysis of the 
compound words provide insights on the insertion of the noun class 
prefix in the derivational process. Furthermore, using Distributed 
Morphology in the interpretation of lexicalised meaning, the findings 
provide insights on the complexities and creativity involved in the 
construction of compound words in Cinyanja.

View of The Naming of Zambia's Waterfalls: A Test Case in Critical Toponymy,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1300/926,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1300/926,"ABSTRACT
It has been claimed that the indigenous names of waterfalls were frequently 
replaced by European names. This critical toponymic claim is challenged in 
a test case investigating the names of Zambian waterfalls. The research was 
undertaken in three parts. Firstly, a quantitative study showed that 97 per 
cent of 150 named waterfalls have indigenous rather than colonial names.  
Secondly, the colonial practices and policies that ensured that Zambian 
waterfalls retained their indigenous names were traced through contemporary 
documents. Lastly, the naming motives of ninety-nine waterfalls were 
examined through a toponymic typology to reveal how the indigenous names 
reflect aspects of indigenous culture that are in danger of being marginalised 
or lost. The results refute the critical hypothesis of toponymic silencing and 
establish an evidence-based narrative of a colonial policy that ensured that the 
indigenous names of waterfalls were retained.  European names were adopted 
only if an indigenous name could not be identified."
"View of Intercultural Communication Practices in Chinese Firms in Lusaka, Zambia: Perspectives of Zambian Employees",Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1301/927,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1301/927,"ABSTRACT
This article highlights the Intercultural Communication Practices in Chinese 
Multinational Companies (MNCs) in Zambia with a particular focus on Zambian 
employees’ perspectives. It explores communication practices in Chinese firms 
in Lusaka, understanding Zambian workers’ perceptions of communication 
with Chinese counterparts, and identifying barriers to effective communication. 
Employing a Phenomenological approach, two (02) Chinese MNCs in Zambia 
were studied: China Jiangsu International and Avic International (Zambia) 
Limited. Ten employees were interviewed. The findings indicate the use of 
interpreters, oral communication, and gestures for daily activities exchange. 
While some found these practices effective, others faced challenges due to 
intercultural differences. Barriers include lack of respect for elders, disregard for 
pleasantries, and impatience among Chinese employees. The study concludes 
that Chinese MNCs lack adequate attention to intercultural communication 
strategies, thus recommending the implementation of deliberate improvement 
measures."
"View of The Resemiotisation and Intertextuality of Multimodal Discourses in Linguistic Landscape of Public Service Vehicles in Lusaka, Zambia",Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1313/933,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1313/933,"ABSTRACT
Using resemiotisation and intertextuality as analytical tools in the broader 
theoretical conexts of linguistic landscapes and semiotic studies, this article 
accounts for the diverse and heavily saturated multimodal discourses emplaced 
on public service vehicles in Lusaka, Zambia (South-Central Africa). As its 
locus, the study wishes to to unearth the textual and sociocultural sources 
of emplaced discourses privileging local materialities, agency, and voice. To 
this end, the article reveals that the multimodal discourses on public service 
vehicles bring religion into the spotlight, particularly Christianity, as a 
sociocultural reality of social actors. It is shown that the emplaced multimodal 
discourses are inescapably related to other texts and narratives predominantly 
associated with Zambias’ christian religious underpinnings. In this way, the 
article concludes that resemiotisation and intertextuality are at play in the 
textual trajectory of discourses seen on public service vehicles in Lusaka, 
Zambia."
View of Complicating the Language of Conventional Nigerian Narratives: The Poetics of the Language Ofokri’s Narratives.,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1205/885,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1205/885,"ABSTRACT 
Nigerian narratives, from Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart (1958) to 
contemporary ones, have always resorted to the technique of realism by which 
they seek to make art correspond to life. These narratives were, therefore, 
metonymic, Roman Jakobson’s manner of describing language standing in for 
a state of reality. This circumstance persisted until Ben Okri’s mature novels 
deviated from it through being metaphoric and the deployment of unfamiliar 
characterisation, settings, action and language. By this deviation, Okri’s 
narratives seem to have ruptured the metonymic and the concretising literary 
language traditional to Nigerian narratives, an issue that has remained largely 
overlooked. Using Roman Jakobson’s linguistics and sundry descriptive 
methods (since Jakobson’s thought relevant to this study does not exceed 
metaphor and metonymy), this article teases out the variegated dimensions 
through which the literary language of Ben Okri’s latter works undermine 
and complicate the conventional literary language of Nigerian narratives. 
Focusing on this language, this article analyses, first, the metonymic – the 
tendency in the language of Nigerian literature and Okri’s earlier narratives 
to evoke a familiar reality; second, the metaphoric; third, the redefinition of 
human actions; fourth, the dissonance between the signifier and the signified in 
signs signifying institutional concepts; fifth, paradoxes; and last, parallelisms. 
It concludes that with the language of Okri’s later works so tied to his will-
to-narrate in a way subversive of the technique of realism, while representing 
perceived resemblances through related poetic elements and features, he 
breathes fresh and rich energies into Nigeria’s existing realistic literature as 
well as flustering critics’ expectations."
View of Evaluating the Key Roles of Contract Administrators in the Zambian Construction Industry,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1201/881,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1201/881,"ABSTRACT
The nature of the construction contract administrator’s role from project commencement 
to completion is multifaceted and complex. Additionally, successfully performing the role, 
requires various skills. Different perspectives exist on what contract administrators do 
and what competencies are necessary for the day-to-day administration of a construction 
contract. The aim of the study was to determine contract administrators’ key roles in the 
Zambian construction industry. This study  provides literature that gives an understanding of 
what role contract administrators should fulfil. Having this knowledge will enable them to 
carry out their functions effectively and this will foster completion of construction projects 
within the stipulated conditions of the contracts. This research shows the key roles of a 
contract administrator at the various stages of construction that are categorised depending 
on a particular stage of construction. These roles include risk-related, cost, schedule, 
procurement, integration and resource-related roles."
View of What's in a Name? The Place of Language in the Naming of Programmes in the Zambian Radio and Television Industry,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1202/882,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1202/882,"ABSTRACT
The old Shakespearian rhetorical question, ‘What’s in a name?’ comes to the 
fore when we examine the names given to programmes by Zambian radio 
and television stations. While most people are not bothered by such names 
and would argue that it is the content of the programmes that is paramount, 
not the names thereof, it may be argued that the names are worth analysing 
from the perspective of onomastics, which is the scientific study of names 
and naming systems. No study has been conducted on the names of radio 
and television programmes in Zambia, and this is the lacuna that this study 
is concerned with. The study is qualitative in nature and analyses names of 
programmes in both public and private media houses. More specifically, the 
study concerns itself with the language used in the naming – that is, whether 
local names are used apart from English names and if so, which Zambian 
languages are the local names associated with. The findings reveal that none 
of the media houses selected for the study has a formal or written policy on 
language use. The naming of programmes tends to follow a linguistic pattern 
similar to what obtains with regard to the use of language: the public media 
has more programmes with names in local languages than the private media. 
Ultimately, however, the findings of this study underline the fact that there is no 
formal language policy guiding the affairs of the nation. It may be concluded, 
therefore, that the situation cannot be corrected or ameliorated without a clear 
language policy at national level."
View of The Role of Social Media in Promoting Citizen Participation in Zimbabwe's Urban Local Authorities,Sociology,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1203/883,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1203/883,"ABSTRACT 
Social media is now widely used across the globe having the potential 
to enhance citizen participation in governance processes. Such platforms 
include Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp amongst others, to be interrogated 
in this study. The study sought to examine how these social media platforms 
can be used to enhance citizen participation in Zimbabwe’s urban local 
authorities using Bulawayo and Harare City Councils as case studies. The 
two local authorities have a huge footprint on social media. Theoretically, 
the study was informed by Arnstein’s ladder of participation to explore 
the use of social media in enhancing citizen participation. The researchers 
purposively and conveniently selected participants that included the 
residents, councillors and management. The researchers also reviewed and 
synthesised comments made on different social media accounts of the two 
cases. Data were analysed thematically where themes were established to 
deduce meaning guided by the research questions. Findings show that social 
media presents a huge potential if embraced to enhance citizen participation 
for it has a wider audience and also its ability to include young, people 
which is the larger population, using social media. Challenges associated 
with the use of social media were also established including the high cost 
of data in Zimbabwe. Also, these platforms do not go beyond the tokenism 
stage of the Arnstein ladder of Participation making them less effective. 
Lastly, recommendations are given on how to strengthen the use of social 
media in promoting citizen participation."
View of Municipal Solid Waste Management: An Assessment of the Management Framework In Zambia,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1204/884,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1204/884,"ABSTRACT
Governance mechanisms for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) are critical to the 
sustainable management of waste for effective environmental management and 
public health. These mechanisms are dependent on management frameworks 
upon which they are based. This study aimed at assessing current frameworks 
for managing MSW in Zambia using a descriptive research design with 
a questionnaire being the data collection tool. Eighty purposively sampled 
respondents were administered and the tool had a 90 per cent response rate. 
Data analysis involved the use of frequency tables, percentages, bar, the mean, 
and standard deviation. The results were as follows; male respondents were 73 
per cent as compared to female respondents at 27 per cent,  respectively, while 
source of generation for residential areas was at 88 per cent. Public sector 
role in the governance of MWS 66.7 per cent, private sector (18.9%), NGOs 
(7.8%), with academia 2.2 per cent, others 4.4 per cent respectively.  Frequency 
of collection was as follows: daily (45.7%), twice a week (14.9%), weekly 
(39.4%). Recycling of MSW by the private sector (47.2%), municipality 
(14.6%), and a combination of both accounted for 38.2 per cent. Management 
of final disposal sites by private sector (11.7%), municipalities (44.6%) 
and co-managed sites (43.5%). Lack of technical capacity to develop and 
implement policies by municipalities was 33 per cent while lack of financial 
resources for the waste management sector (39%). The results of the study 
indicate a growing and rooted challenge in the governance of MSW in Zambia. 
Therefore, governance mechanisms must be based on robust and effective 
frameworks that will ensure effective service delivery by local authorities 
with the involvement of all stakeholders, gender and social inclusion and also 
effective development and application of policies, technology and financial 
resources. This will result into sustainable waste management service to 
protect public health and the environment and ultimately implement a circular 
economy model."

View of Cross-Country Document Analysis of Play-Based Learning in Early Childhood Education in Zambia and Beyond,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1162/867,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1162/867,"Abstract
This research examined the incorporation of play-based learning in Early 
Childhood Education (ECE) policies across Zambia and twenty other 
diverse countries. Through document analysis, it uncovers commonalities 
and disparities in play-based learning principles. While both Zambian 
and global documents emphasise the significance of play in child 
development, they differ in scope, regional practices, and emphasis on 
global advocacy and cultural variations. Zambia’s documents highlight 
specific practices, while global perspectives offer a broader international 
view. Both stress the multifaceted benefits of play in physical, cognitive, 
social, and emotional growth. In summary, the findings underscored a 
global consensus on the significance of play-based learning in early 
childhood education, emphasising its role in holistic child development. 
Additionally, they highlighted the imperative of recognising cultural 
diversity and aligning policies with child rights, particularly in the 
Zambian context. Furthermore, the recommendations were aimed at 
bolstering the effectiveness of play-based pedagogies in early childhood 
education. They advocated for celebrating diversity, fostering holistic 
development, and ensuring the availability of appropriate resources and 
guidelines to support this approach. These recommendations ultimately 
seek to enhance the quality of early childhood education in Zambia 
by embracing cultural diversity, promoting global collaboration, and 
aligning play-based pedagogies with local and international best 
practices."
View of Exploring Early Childhood Education Teachers' Play-Based Learning Pedagogical Practices in Zambia,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1163/866,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1163/866,"Abstract
Although learning takes place throughout life, that which occurs 
during childhood will never be equaled (UNICEF, 2018). Play 
is a legitimate right in early childhood (Smith, 2013) and 
one of the most natural pathways to exploration and learning 
(Saskatchewan, 2018). However, although play is a legitimate 
right way of learning in Zambia (MOGE 2013), in practice 
its implementation varies from school to school (Lungu, 
2023).  This study explored the play-based pedagogies related 
to play-based learning of ECE teachers in Zambia and their 
preparedness to use play as a teaching technique. The study 
employed a concurrent or convergent parallel mixed-method 
design. A total of 30 ECE teachers across three districts of 
Zambia participated in this study. One-to-one interviews were 
used to collect qualitative data, while structured questionnaires 
were used to collect quantitative data for the study. Statistical 
Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)  version 25 was used 
to generate descriptive statistics while qualitative data was 
analysed using content analysis. The findings revealed that a 
considerable portion (83%) of ECE teachers perceived their 
training as sufficient for teaching using play-based pedagogies, 
but a notable minority expressed the need for more effective 
training and support in this regard. Further, the findings 
revealed that PBL was widely incorporated in ECE in Zambia. 
Among the commonly employed PBL pedagogical practices, 
teachers consistently incorporated elements such as games, 
role plays and dramatic play, storytelling, outdoor activities, 
individual work, pair work, group work, demonstrations, as 
well as rhymes and songs. However, the study noted a concern 
about the connectedness of play activity with the content of the 
day. It was observed that there was no connectedness between 
play activities and the content of the day. In addition, learning 
was not captivating enough as teachers were not so creative 
in using play as a vehicle to deliver curriculum content to 
the learners. These findings have crucial implications for the 
enhancement of ECE in Zambia. They underscore the value of"
View of Exploring School Readiness and Transition Dynamics: Enablers and Disablers in Early Childhood Education Programmes of Zambia,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1164/865,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1164/865,"Abstract 
This qualitative study investigated the complex issues and 
dynamics associated with the transitions in early childhood 
education (ECE) within Kabwe, Kapiri, and Choma districts 
of Zambia. Utilising an exploratory methodology, the research 
thoroughly explored the various factors that impacted school 
preparedness and the progression from early childhood 
education to primary schools. Diverse perspectives from 
parents, educators, community leaders, and legislators 
were examined through in-depth interviews, focus groups, 
and participant observations. The results of this study shed 
light on several significant factors such as limited parental 
involvement arising from knowledge gaps and financial 
constraints, digital inequality affecting children’s adaptability, 
and the absence of well-structured transition programmes 
leading to mismatches in instructional approaches. Thematic 
analysis reveals nuanced insights, emphasising the crucial 
role of digital inclusion initiatives, programmes promoting 
parental engagement, and collaborative efforts between ECE 
institutions and primary schools."
View of A Systematic Review of Early Childhood Education and Primary School Readiness for Transition Through Play-Based Pedagogies,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1165/864,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1165/864,"Abstract 
This systematic review is based on studies that explored 
school readiness and transition through play-based pedagogies 
in Early Childhood and Primary Education. Relevant literature 
involved global literature whose search was conducted by 
independent researchers following the keyword string, which 
included among others, stakeholders’ roles in school readiness, 
transition, and play-based pedagogies. The literature search 
was done from May to August 2022 following the Preferred 
Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis 
Protocols (PRISMA). Twenty peer-reviewed studies were 
identified, appraised, and included in the review. Findings from 
international literature showed that teachers’ implementation 
of play-based pedagogy revealed a significant and positive 
relationship to all domains of children’s holistic development. 
Learner assessment for school readiness and transitioning 
from pre-primary to primary through play-based pedagogies 
included academic, social, and personal learning during 
periods of play. The types of play-based assessments for school 
readiness identified included: (1) withdrawal assessment, 
(2) observational assessment, (3) embedded assessment, (4) 
teacher questioning/interview, (5) Photographs/videos and 
(6) documentation walls. While literature showed a positive 
connection between parental involvement and a child’s 
readiness for school including successful transition from 
preprimary to primary school, there was limited evidence 
pointing specifically to the influence of parental involvement 
in play-based pedagogies for school transitioning."
View of Stakeholder Perspectives of Pbl and Their Involvement in the Implementation of Play Pedagogy in Selected Schools Offering ECE in Southern and Central Zambia,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1166/863,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1166/863,"Abstract
While several studies have been done on parental involvement 
in early childhood education, gaps still exists relating to 
the conceptualisation of play and play-based learning in 
different contexts.  The various perceptions of play and play-
based learning have a strong influence on their involvement 
in play-based learning activities involving children in Early 
Childhood Education. Using a qualitative approach, framed 
within the interpretive research paradigm, this study revealed 
a disjuncture between the positive perception held by the 
stakeholders on play and PBL to the reality of play-based 
learning in the ECE schools. The researchers asked three 
questions: 1. What are the perceptions of parents, community, 
and school administrators (teachers and administrators) 
regarding play and play-based learning? 2. How do these 
stakeholders get involved in PBL? 3. And what factors 
influence their involvement? The researchers collected 
data through key informant interviews (KII), focus group 
discussions and classroom observations. The study established 
that the involvement in PBL varied among stakeholders. 
For parents and community members their involvement was 
often based on solicitation by the school administrators and 
external development agencies - as opposed to volunteering 
postulated by Epstein’s theory of parental involvement 
employed in the study. Among the factors that influenced their 
participation was a general lack of a clear understanding of 
PBL and their role and functions in PBL and ECE in general.  
Thus, the study recommends capacity building in PBL for 
parents, community members and school administrators."
"View of Higher Education, Femininity and Fertility: Exploring Lived Experiences of Educated Women in Mazabuka, Zambia",Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1124/839,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1124/839,"Abstract 
This study investigated the experiences of women with higher education 
on fertility rate in Mazabuka district, Zambia. It is based on contraceptive 
practice and reproduction, transcendence of cultural beliefs and practices 
that suppress women on fertility control. The study invoked the theory of 
demand and supply promulgated by Gary and Becker. The interpretive 
phenomenological research design was utilised.  A sample of fifteen educated 
women, possessing a minimum of master’s degree, were purposively sampled. 
Data was collected through face-to-face interviews was analysed, using 
Inductive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) thematic analysis. The findings 
of the research among others, revealed that the years of schooling had affected 
educated women’s fertility because they postponed marriage and child bearing 
due to schooling. The study also found that years of schooling had promoted, 
empowered and given women the independence to an extent that some men 
were intimidated to marry them. The women were also aware of the benefits, 
risks, effectiveness, effects and the correct use of contraceptives. Based on 
the findings, the study recommends, among others, the need for society to be 
sensitised on the social, economic and private benefits of marrying and having 
children with an educated woman."
View of The Roles and Challenges of Policewomen in the Zambia Police 1966–1995,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1125/843,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1125/843,"Abstract
This study examines the roles and challenges of women in male dominated 
institutions focusing on the case of Zambia Police from 1966 to 1995. Primary 
and secondary sources were consulted. Primary sources used included oral 
interviews, consulting colonial and post-colonial government reports and 
conference papers. The secondary sources include books, dissertations and 
journals. The study argues that Zambia Police Service formerly known 
as Northern Rhodesia Police was formed in 1932 and at inception it only 
comprised men with no intentions of considering the inclusion of female 
Police officers. In 1947, the Force started employing clerks and African 
civilians that included twelve women. The female clerks and wives of the 
senior police officers helped the Force to search, guard and escort female and 
juvenile offenders to their convenience rooms. The study further reveals that 
it was very important for the Force to consider the recruitment and training 
of female police officers and equip them with police skills as a pilot project.  
European women were first engaged and trained as police officers in 1955 and 
the African first females during 1958. The roles of these policewomen were 
mainly confined to clerical and administrative work. In 1966, two years after 
independence, the Force started recruitment and training of policewomen on 
a permanent basis. Policewomen found it difficult to adapt to the work culture 
of men towards them because they were discriminated against in many ways. 
The policewomen were faced with a number of challenges and barriers that 
hindered their advancement in the police. The study concluded that from 1966 
to 1995, policewomen contributed to maintenance of law and order in the 
country. Despite the challenges they faced they were able to gain recognition, 
acceptance and promotion to higher ranks."
View of An Epistemic Survey of African (Igbo) Notions of Knowledge in Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1086/840,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1086/840,"Abstract
This study undertakes an epistemic survey of the notions of knowledge among 
Igbos of Nigeria as couched in Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart. In this 
work, Achebe relives the vibrant world of Igbo people before the advent of 
colonialists in Nigeria. Therefore, the study unveils the roles and significance 
of knowledge among the Igbos, the beauty and depth of the people’s values 
system as enshrined in their culture and traditions. It also exposes the place of 
elders and oral tradition as both purveyors and repository of knowledge hence, 
their relevance in Igbo knowledge acquisition process. The work showcases 
that life among the Igbos was chiefly communal. Knowledge in this society, 
was acquired through collective experience and wisdom by individual persons’ 
participation in the community’s rituals, myths and folklores. However, the 
researcher adopted the hermeneutical and textual analysis methods of inquiry, 
which enabled the researcher to interpret and analyse the Novel, Things Fall 
Apart. In line with our hermeneutical method, we clarified the meaning of 
Omenani (traditions) of the people and its’ influence on the epistemology of 
the people. This study found that any strongly held beliefs or cultural values, 
which bring only crises when people of different cultures interact, necessitates 
the need for the cultivation of proper epistemological modesty instead of a 
tenacious attachment to customs and traditions. Lastly, our study recommends 
a relevant epistemic change as panacea to cultural and social rifts. This

engendering inter-cultural interactions and ensuring social harmony even

solving system is located in the idea of epistemic inter-culturalism."
View of An Examination of Consumerism and the Role of Technology in Don DeLillo’s White Noise and Cosmopolis,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1126/842,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1126/842,"Abstract
Human society has entered an era marked by myriad phenomena collectively 
labeled ‘modernisation’. Over the past 100 years, scientific breakthroughs 
and technological innovations have radically changed the human experience. 
Almost everything we touch or use in our homes, our garages, our offices is the 
by-product of an intense and complex industrial system: our consumption of 
goods is notably a function of our culture. We are surrounded by a manufactured 
world. Like most phenomena, the critical reality lies not in the general 
characteristics of modernisation, but in the particular and unique conditions of 
people’s lives, and the effects of modernisation in the places where we live: in 
our homes, our communities, our natural and cultural environments. Two texts 
which are concerned with an exploration of the complexities of modernisation, 
particularly technology and the resultant consumerist culture, are Don DeLillo’s 
White Noise and Cosmopolis. The purpose of this study was to examine the 
relationship that exists between consumerism and technology in the two texts. 
This investigation used historical, philosophical and psychological theories. 
From a historical perspective, the study focused on contextual approaches, 
which looked at the historical development of technologies in relation to their 
social context. Employing postmodern theories, the characters’ motivations 
to buy and consume products in both texts were discussed. In essence, it 
was noted that consumerism physically and mentally affects consumers. 
On the physical level, people living in the consumerist society cannot avoid 
its tentacles because there are too many outside forces keeping them in the 
system. Technology has become as much a part of the texture of daily life as 
humans are themselves. In fact, the two seem inextricable. In both White Noise 
and Cosmopolis, the pervasive presence of technology proves both menacing 
and comforting—toxic threats abound, while concurrently the characters are 
bombarded with advertised information and promises of immortality through 
scientific advancements. Thus, consumers relentlessly buy products and feel 
that the products they buy determine their identity.
Key Words: 	Consumerism, technology, modernisation and modernity, postmodernity,

View of The Use of Allusion in Tonga Work Songs: Its Social and Economic  Implication,Sociology,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/919/841,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/919/841,"Abstract 
This article sets out to examine the use of allusion in selected Tonga work 
songs. Whereas there is extensive and impressive documentation about the 
Tonga people and their culture, their history, and even their literature, by 
authors like Elizabeth Colson, there is hardly any documentation on the use of 
allusion and its social implications in Tonga work songs. Therefore, this study 
gives utter attention to one poetic element – the allusion, in the Tonga work 
songs and argues that allusion reflects the Tonga people’s social and economic 
activities through work songs. The study mainly used the qualitative method 
to collect data from respondents. This article is a brain child of research work 
which was conducted in two ways namely, through desk research and field 
research in three districts of Southern Province in Zambia. A total of 35 work 
songs were collected through interview guide, questionnaires, and Focus 
Group Discussions. The study revealed that Tonga work songs help lighten 
the work, comment on perpetual unpalatable social tendencies, communicate 
values of hard work, social cohesion, and objectives and share memories of the 
past other than culture transmission to the young generation. The study also 
revealed that Tonga Work songs are rich in Poetic elements such as allusion 
that inculcate a sense of self-responsibility among others. The study further 
reveals that allusion in Tonga work songs reflects Tonga people’s past and 
their agricultural inclination, a reflection of Tonga’s main economic activity. 
What comes out of this study also is that there are hardly any allusions to 
Tonga’s paramountcy of chiefs like in other tribes in southern Africa."

View of A Socio-Semantic Etymological Analysis of Selected Nicknames Within the Zambian Senga Social and Cultural Onomastics Cosmology,Sociology,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1010/768,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1010/768,"ABSTRACT 
This study examined the social-semantic meaning of selected Zambian Senga 
nicknames within the Senga social and cultural milieu. It unveiled the social-
semantic significance of selected Senga nicknames in relation to their social 
and cultural setting. It also established the etymology of the names as well as 
the social cultural significance of meanings expressed in the nicknames. This 
study adopted a qualitative approach. A purposive sampling technique was 
employed through which fourteen persons, who were considered sufficiently 
knowledgeable in the Senga language, provided an accurate explanation of 
the data. The participants were drawn from Chama District of the Eastern 
Province of Zambia. Data was collected through an interview guide, which 
was administered to the selected research participants. Data was analysed 
using Social Semiotic Theory. In line with social semiotics, nicknames express 
both connotative and denotative meanings. In addition, Senga nicknames 
have social and cultural significance in that they warn witches, discourage 
selfishness, provide wisdom, encourage, demonstrate endurance, reprimand, 
teach self-reliance, show ownership, discourage laziness, expose promiscuous 
behaviour, hard work and traditional beliefs. Lastly, it is recommended that 
other aspects of Senga anthroponyms may be researched on. These might 
include personal names, their etymology and semantic value."
"View of Views of College Lecturers on the Integration of Music, Art and Design and Physical Education into Expressive Arts in Zambia: An Exploratory Study",Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1011/769,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1011/769,"Abstract
The concerns of an overloaded curriculum persisted in Zambia’s education 
system as far back as 1992. This lasted until 2002 when the number of subjects 
was reduced from 11 to 5 in primary schools and from fourteen to six in colleges 
of education. The study established lecturers’ views on the integration of music, 
art and design and physical education subjects into expressive arts in colleges 
of education in Zambia in order to gain insights on prospects and challenges 
of how the process of integration was done and its implications on the subjects 
involved. A qualitative approach was adopted for the study in order to gain an 
understanding of arts integration through the views of college lecturers who train 
primary school teachers. Twenty-four lecturers were conveniently selected from 
ten colleges of education. Data was collected using semi-structured interviews 
and analysed along common themes that arose from participants narratives. The 
findings revealed that college lecturers saw arts integration as the merging of 
three subjects into one, a combination of more than two subjects that are related 
to one another in a number of ways such a s having similar competencies, and 
merging them into topics. The study reported some benefits and prospects of 
arts integration as ranging from according lessons a more practical approach, 
enhancing creativity among leaners, promoting transfer of learning, to supporting 
collaboration among lecturers and learners. Further, it was found that there were 
a number of challenges to arts integration ranging from time constraint, lack of 
human resource, lack of teaching and learning materials to limited knowledge 
to teach subjects as integrated. The study concluded that lecturers lacked a 
philosophical understanding of integration and were largely unable to integrate 
the subjects as expressive arts in actual teaching."
View of Coping With Racism: An Analysis of Defence Mechanisms Employed by Lubinda in Dominic Mulaisho's The Tongue of the Dumb,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1012/770,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1012/770,"Abstract
Sensitive as racism may be, it has continued to be a problematic reality, a 
thematic issue and a subject of scholarly discourse. Racism negatively impacts 
societies and individuals. Thus, the attention and need for relentless efforts in 
addressing, ameliorating, combating, eradicating and mitigating it. This paper 
concerns itself with representations and experiences of Racism in Dominic 
Mulaisho’s The Tongue of the Dumb. Using the Defence Mechanism Theory 
of Psychoanalysis, it investigates the defence mechanisms employed by a 
prominent character, Lubinda, to cope with racism. Further, the study explores 
the role and significance of defence mechanisms in coping with racism. The 
research was qualitative. Data was collected by textual analysis of the selected 
novel and analysed thematically.  The findings of the study show that affiliation, 
humour, identification with the aggressor, sublimation, passive aggression and 
sublimation were utilised by the character. The usefulness and protectiveness of 
defence mechanisms is observable and it is rendered prudent to be acquainted 
with these mechanisms as stressful situations and unpleasant experiences are 
inevitable.

View of A Stylistic and Thematic Analysis of Zambian Prison Poetry: The Case of Mwembeshi Maximum Security Prison,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/1013/771,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/1013/771,"Abstract
How the same theme is expressed in different poems, among different poets, 
is an interesting area of inquiry because style can determine the treatment of 
theme. Thus, this article dealt with a stylistic and thematic analysis of selected 
poems written by inmates of Mwembeshi Maximum Security Prison, and the 
relationship between the poetry and the prisoners’ prison experience. The study 
proceeded from the premise that inmate poetry offers authentic experience 
about life in prison. To achieve its aim the study utilised thematic and stylistic 
analysis of the poems.  Among the key findings of the study is the idea that 
the poems were not only authentic but were reflection of the deepest feelings 
of the writers, thematically fresh and touching. The study concluded that most 
of the poems exhibit themes and stylistic approaches that reflect their prison 
lived experience and that not all poems use figures of speech to express their 
prison lived experience."
"View of Namwali Serpell's the Old Drift as a Postcolonial Text: A Semiotic, Linguistic and Onomastic Analysis",Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/789/656,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/789/656,"Abstract
This essay analyses Namwali Serpell’s seminal novel The Old Drift from 
a postcolonial perspective. In pursuing this goal, the essay utilises some 
aspects of postcolonial theory, semiotics, onomastics and linguistics. 
In particular, it looks at how Serpell reinterprets the history of colonial 
Zambia as projected and interpreted by colonial writers. The findings 
suggest that the novel epitomises a new drift in Zambian literature. The 
novel problematises the views of the imperial centre as exemplified in 
colonial literature and suggests that the colonisers used the gun, fraud, 
deception, language and names as some of the means of subjugating the 
local people and dispossessing them of their land. Therefore, the whole 
colonial enterprise was pursued for the benefit of the white settlers at 
the expense of the local people and was motivated by greed, selfishness 
and self-aggrandisement."
View of Peculiarity of Retirement Adjustment: A Study of Selected Retired Military Officers in Nigeria,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/790/658,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/790/658,"Abstract
Retirement is a normal and ubiquitous phenomenon in the world of work. 
Every worker must retire owing to the fact that retirement is inevitable 
and no individual can work for eternity due to senescence. However, 
retirement comes with adjustment and adaptation in relation to different 
professions and skills or vocations. This study adopted a survey 
research method; using accidental and snowballing sampling technique 
with key informant interview (KII) and focus group discussion (FGD) 
as research instruments. The analysis was done using a qualitative 
method of content analysis to present the peculiarity of retirement 
adjustment among selected retired military officers in Nigeria. From 
the analysis, the adjustment is divided into two namely: social and 
economy retirement. The social adjustment includes changes in lifestyle 
in general. It includes but is not limited to changes in the living 
environment that warrants adapting to the lack of appropriate space 
to exercise and other recreational  facilities such as visit to Officers’ 
Mess and complying with community security instructions amongst 
others. Economy retirement adjustment is characterised by less income, 
gratuity (less than salary) and increased spending owing to the need to 
budget for payment of bills such as security, electricity, transportation 
and even accommodation in some instances. Meanwhile, officers 
become more frugal and thus, have to reduce financial commitment to 
family and friends resulting from less income. Financial adjustment 
has been found to affect social adjustment as finance is a major factor 
that determines social involvement, especially in relation to financial 
commitment to family and friends. Recommendations such as the need 
for retirement education and training of officers in choiced occupation 
before and after retirement becomes imperative among others."
View of Portrayal of Women Through Zambian Memes,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/791/657,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/791/657,"Abstract
Among internet content produced by internet users, are memes. 
Facebook and WhatsApp have become an integral part of society in 
this age of social media where the young generation and older adults 
engage in social interaction. These memes, sometimes, carry wrong 
perceptions and messages that can create false consciousness among 
the people. The notion of gender is culturally and socially constructed. 
Social media sites have reinforced the concept of gender stereotyping 
through its content. These sites are invisibly controlling people’s lives by 
transferring the stereotyped ideology. Stereotypes have been a central 
theme in memes on social media. Some Facebook and WhatsApp memes 
are portraying women in the way gender roles have been represented. 
The study adopted a disparagement or superiority theory and social 
constructionism theory to examine the content of Zambian memes. Data 
for this article was drawn from general scanning of Facebook and 
WhatsApp. This study analyses how women are portrayed in Zambian 
memes on social media, particularly Facebook and WhatsApp. In this 
regard, this study used purposive sampling and selected 100 Facebook 
and WhatsApp memes as samples but only thirty were analysed in this 
study. Using thematic analysis of the sample, the representations of 
women in the Zambian memes sampled exhibited negative constructions 
of women and womanhood. Further, the findings showed that the 
language used in Zambian memes not only imparts joy and laughter, 
but also some statements that convey hatred, sarcasm, viciousness, and 
vulgarity to women."
View of An Examination of Common Errors in Essays Written By Secondary School Students in Malawi: Some Implications for Teaching,Law,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/792/655,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/792/655,"Abstract 
This study aimed at analysing errors in essays written by Malawian 
students who were learning English as a Second Language (ESL). Its 
specific focus was three-fold: to analyse errors using Corder’s (1974) 
five-stage approach to Error Analysis, to assess sources of the errors 
and to identify measures that could be applied to help students attain 
proficiency in English. The study utilised qualitative and quantitative 
designs. The participants in this study were students and teachers. 
The former were required to write essays which were analysed using 
Corder’s (1974) five-stage approach to Error Analysis while the latter 
were interviewed to establish sources of errors and ways to overcome 
them. The study has revealed that the following were the most frequent 
errors: tense, spelling, subject-verb agreement, articles, nouns, 
capitalisation and fragment. The study has further revealed that inter-
lingual and intra-lingual interferences were the main sources of errors. 
The study has further demonstrated that other factors such as a lapse in 
reading culture, carelessness and social media’s writing style influence 
students’ errors. This study has shown that Error Analysis is helpful 
to teachers because it enables them to identify specific and common 
problems. Teachers can, therefore, focus more attention on the identified 
problems. The findings have pedagogical implications for ESL teachers 
because they would employ appropriate pedagogy to minimise students’ 
errors in the area of grammar and sentence structures. The findings 
also have practical implications in the sense that some platforms could 
be organised in order to grill teachers on how to improve their content 
and pedagogical skills in ESL writing. Teachers could also use these 
platforms to share their experiences with fellow teachers and map the 
way forward to improve their instruction skills."
View of Application of Political Satire in Mission to Kala and Devil on The Cross,Political Science,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/793/654,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/793/654,"Abstract
The study attempted to demonstrate how political satire is applied 
in a pre-independence African fiction Mission to Kala and a post-
independence African fiction Devil on the Cross. Satire, mild or bitter, 
has a history of being used to expose the negative socio-economic and 
political realities perpetrated by both the sympathisers of colonialism 
and later the agents of neo-colonialism in the post-independence phase. 
The study employed the Marxist literary theory and Literary Onomastics 
through stylistic analysis and demonstrated how satire exposed the evils 
and how a ‘training camp’ in the colonial era was transformed into 
a ‘jungle’ in post-independent Africa. Character types in both periods 
exhibited parasitic traits such as greed, selfishness, narrow appetites and 
sadistic violence leading to exploitation and oppression. This historical 
transition was delineated on the basis of the colonised African elite and 
subordinates as the direct off-shoot of the African bourgeoisie groups, 
which created a symbolic connection between the two periods of time in 
the African context. The findings indicated that both texts maintained the 
Marxist outlook, employed ironic juxtaposition to satirise capitalism, 
each satirist employed a different style and Beti had the colonised 
African elite and subordinates as his targets of satire as opposed to 
Ngugi’s comprador politicians, comprador and national bourgeoisie. 
The masses were not spared of criticism."
View of Mining Associations in Zambia Supporting Women in Small-Scale Mining: A Case Study of Zambian Women in Mining Association,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/767/636,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/767/636,"Abstract
This article focuses on the findings presented from the primary data collected 
on the Mining Associations in Zambia in general, supporting women in small-
scale mining. Using the case study approach, particular attention is given 
to the Zambian Women in Mining Association (AZWIM) that was created 
specifically for women. The selection of the case study site was purposive 
since the association specifically supports women in small-scale mining. The 
data collected from the case study used the empirical method of observing 
the facts within their natural surroundings without any attempt to interpret 
those facts. In addition, eco-feminism as a feminist methodology that supports 
social change through activism was used to analyse the findings. Ideas 
and lessons were drawn from three selected examples from different parts 
of the world that embrace eco-feminist activism. Firstly, from ‘The Chikpo 
Movement’ in India where women saved the indigenous forests and their water 
resources from destruction by the limestone mining companies. Secondly, from 
the possibility to save from collapse the Brazilian dam which was created 
by the accumulation of the tailing over a decade of mining activities. The 
overflowing mud from the dam destroyed the communities and the eco-systems 
caused by the mining companies’ negligence. Finally, from the feminist table 
an initiative formed after the death of thirty-four mine workers during a strike 
in Marikana, a mining town in South Africa to help not only the mine workers 
but the women who supported the men who went on strike. The case study 
findings showed that there was a clear need to use eco-feminist activism in 
the mining associations as per the ideas and lessons drawn from the three 
selected examples to overcome the oppression of women and damage to the 
environment in small-scale mining in Zambia."
View of Culture-Specific Items in the Chichewa Translation of Achebe's Things Fall Apart,Sociology,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/768/635,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/768/635,"Abstract
The  article analyses ‘Chipasupasu’ a Chichewa translation of Achebe’s ‘Things 
Fall Apart’ to determine the strategies adopted in translating culture-specific 
items (CSIs) into Chichewa. Specifically, it seeks to address the following 
questions: what treatment – foreignisation or domestication – is given to 
individual CSIs in the translation?; which translation strategy is dominant 
in the translated text? and what is the nature of the meanings that resulted 
from the translation process, following the use of the dominating strategy? 
Data comprised extracts from the two novels and these were tabulated and 
analysed to identify translation strategies used in the translation of each CSI. 
The analysis was carried out considering Venuti’s (1995) domestication and 
foreignisation model, which states that the former is target-culture oriented 
and seeks to achieve a natural translation in the target language while the 
latter is source-culture oriented and ensures that a translated text is literal 
and faithful to the original text. As the findings show, the translator used 
foreignisation as his main tool for handling CSIs, in some cases he had no 
other option, while in other cases he did it deliberately; this tendency made 
foreignisation a dominant strategy in the translation, as its occurrence 
is 75 per cent as compared with that of domestication; as a result of this 
dominance, some of the results are plausible, while others are confusing and 
fail to communicate. Indeed, the preference of one strategy over the other 
depends on the translator and the ultimate function of the translation. This 
article however concludes that this translation would remain source-culture 
oriented for the translator and easy to understand for the target reader if the 
choice of foreignisation was accompanied by another tool, such as, the use of 
explanations in form of footnotes."
View of Tonga Funeral Songs: A Path to understanding the Tonga People of Southern Zambia,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/769/634,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/769/634,"Abstract
The focus of this article is on the Tonga funeral songs as a path to understanding 
the Tonga people of southern Zambia. A funeral song also known as dirge is ‘a 
highly stylistic form of expression that is governed by specific poetic recitative 
conventions used to express the feelings of the mourners in a determinate form 
and performance procedure’ (Akporobaro, 2001: 66). Funeral songs (dirges) 
are ubiquitous in Africa and indeed in the Tongaland when death strikes in 
the community. There are a number of activities that take place during and 
after the mourning period and these include song performances, cleansing, 
animal sacrifices, burial, memorial ceremonies and many others. This article 
however concerned with the funeral songs that are performed during the 
funeral among the Tongas. Being a qualitative study, ten informants were 
purposively selected from Gwembe, Choma, Namwala, Mazabuka and Kabwe 
districts respectively. Thematic analysis was employed during data analysis as 
it was found befitting of the qualitative research being undertaken. The article 
restricted itself to songs such as Kuzemba, Kuyabila, Bukonkoolo, Zitengulo, 
Buntibe and Nyeele songs as conduits through which one can understand the 
Tonga people since music is an expression of the social fabric of the culture."

This article is concerned with the significance of land in Chinua 
Achebe’s seminal work ‘Things Fall Apart’. It focuses on questions of 
how the land is distributed and utilised and the attitudes and beliefs 
surrounding it. In handling the question, the article analyses various 
situations and contexts in which issues of land and its use arise. The 
main tool of analysis is ecocriticism complemented by the social 
constructionist theory. The article argues that the Igbo culture as 
presented in Things Fall Apart is a nature-culture characterised by 
land as a culture-scape. The beliefs of the Igbo determine how they 
relate to and use the land. Further the article argues that land is very 
central to the life and lifestyle of the Igbo people as it helps define 
their religion and customary practices.

View of How University of Ilorin Undergraduates Perceive Nigeria's Independent National Electoral Commission's Social Media use for Citizens' Engagement,Sociology,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/771/632,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/771/632,"Abstract
Using mixed method with questionnaire and in-depth interview as instruments 
of data collection, a study was carried out with the objective of finding 
out undergraduates’ perception of the Independent National Electoral 
Commission’s (INEC) deployment of social media to engage citizens. 
Population of the study was 44,919 undergraduates at the University of 
Ilorin, Nigeria from which a sample of 386 was drawn for the quantitative 
aspect and fifteen informants for the qualitative aspect. The quantitative data 
was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences 21 version while 
responses of informants were recorded and transcribed by the researchers. 
Findings showed that undergraduates, who are active users of social media 
perceived messages the electoral body posted as untrustworthy. In addition, 
the body lacked visibility on social media. The study concluded that INEC’s 
use of social media for citizens’ engagement was in response to the demand 
of the contemporary society which social media cannot be ignored. The study 
recommended the need for INEC to be more aggressive in social media use as 
well as build public trust through prompt responses to issues and allegations."
View of Documentation and Memorialisation of the First Battles against Colonisation in Zimbabwe,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/757/625,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/757/625,"Abstract
The first few years of British occupation in Zimbabwe was characterised 
by power struggle between the indigenous population groups who were 
dissatisfied with systematic settler style of dispossessing them of their 
wealth and power. The result was local and regional wars, (Rebellions/
Uprisings/ Umvhukela/ 1st Chimurenga). After the war, the British South 
African Company (BSAC) documented and memorialised most prominent 
battles of the conflict and yet the indigenous people who could not read and 
write could not do the same. The article seeks to motivate Zimbabweans to 
recognise the participation of the indigenous people into this conflict as a 
historic event whose documentation and memorialisation is an important 
component of the liberation heritage of Zimbabwe. The documentation 
and memorialisation of the conflict by the other belligerent is enough 
authentication that the indigenous people staged a brave and heroic fight 
which doubtlessly was characterised by commitment to a genuine cause 
of the black people to protect their birth right. It is only the inability 
to read and write of our ancestry which has mandated us to accept the 
description of the era as a dark history, which is worthy documentation 
and memorialisation for the benefit of the present and future generation. 
The researchers employed qualitative research method of acquiring data 
through desktop research and observation techniques. The article came 
to conclusion that the war between Zimbabwe and the then Rhodesia and 
their opponents should be documented so as to assist the present generation 
appreciate the history of the nation and preserve their heritage."
View of Noun Predication in CiTonga,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/758/626,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/758/626,"Abstract
This study is an account of noun predication in CiTonga. The morphemes 
responsible for noun predication are identified and discussed to bring 
forth their morphosyntactic role. Data for the study are collected mainly 
through intuition. The informing theoretical perspective in the study is 
Distributed Morphology. This theory addresses the interface between 
morphological and syntactic processes. The study advances that noun 
predicative morphemes in Tonga, in addition to converting nouns into 
predicates, implement two degrees of emphasis on the noun to which they are 
preprefixed. It is further noted that each predicative morpheme is restricted 
to specific noun classes. From the data used, the study also notes that 
predicative morphemes (morphemes used to convert noun into predicates) 
are governed by the noun that they predicate morphophonologically. 
In terms of meaning, it is noted that predicate nouns have two levels of 
meaning; the literal and the actual meaning. The study concludes that 
predicative morphemes in CiTonga are highly productive and can be 
analysed phonologically, morphologically, syntactically and semantically."
View of Aspects of Gothic Tradition in the Literary Imagination of Nnedi Okorafor,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/759/627,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/759/627,"Abstract
The Gothic writing has often been perceived as a form of Western fiction- making. 
This apparently is based on the fact that Gothic genre originated in Europe in 
the late 18th century and has been widely exploited in the West (Europe and 
North America). Contrary to these assumptions, it can be confirmed that Gothic 
mode has indeed been appropriated by many non–Western fiction writers. An in-
depth interrogation of Nnedi Okorafor’s, selected novels like ‘Who Fears death’, 
Akata Witch and The Book of Phoenix reveal that she does indeed appropriate 
Gothic elements. This article therefore critically examines aspects of Gothic 
tradition in Nnedi Okorafor’s selected novels. It seeks to portray how unique 
Gothic motifs like monstrosity, villainy and morality have been appropriated, 
transformed and complicated in Nnedi Okorafor’s selected novels ‘Who Fears 
death’, ‘Akata Witch’ and ‘The Book of Phoenix’. This study found out that 
that the three motifs indeed exist in Okorafor’s selected novels and are closely 
related. Gothic Monsters are generally implicated in subversion of social norms 
and nature. This often renders them villainous and their defeat, as portrayed in 
the analysed texts, leads to a restoration of moral order in a given society. Yet 
the findings affirm that physical or moral monstrosity of a character does not 
necessarily qualify her or him to be a villain. Villainy is tied to innate monstrosity 
which manifests itself through characters’ inhuman, unjust, and oppressive 
attitude towards the perceived other. This piece therefore concludes that Nnedi 
Okorafor does indeed appropriate the Gothic motifs of monstrosity, villainy and

View of A Contrastive Study of IciBemba and Mambwe at Phonological Level,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/760/628,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/760/628,"ABSTRACT
A contrastive study between IciBemba and Mambwe at phonological 
level sought to find out how Standard Bemba and Rural Mambwe differ in 
terms of phonology. The investigation was motivated by the proximity of 
Bemba and Mambwe speaking communities in Mbala district of Northern 
province. 
The researcher used qualitative research design because he sought to 
focus on words rather than on numbers. His methods were exploratory 
and descriptive: seeking to unearth the opinions, thoughts and feelings 
of the respondents. In this study, respondents were freely able to disclose 
their experiences, thoughts and feelings without constraint. This research 
design enabled the researcher to have an in-depth involvement by way 
of semi-structured interviews, focus-group discussions and observation. 
The researcher had an opportunity to follow up, through focus-group 
discussions, on the responses given earlier by the key informant who 
is very proficient in Mambwe. All the informants are proficient in the 
languages under study. It is this in-depth involvement by the researcher 
with the informants and his analysis and interpretation of the data that has 
shaped the outcome of this study. 
 The differences have been noted in segmental phonology with regard 
to vowels and consonants, the application of deletion, insertion and 
allophonic rules, sound segments in causative and intensive verbal forms, 
semivocalisation, coalescence and vowel harmony
It is, therefore, concluded from the study that the phonological 
differences between the languages under study contribute to: (1) mutual 
unintelligibility between IciBemba and Mambwe speakers who have had 
no experience of each other’s language and (2) the absence of linguistic 
convergence between IciBemba and Mambwe despite that they are spoken 
in the same geographical space.
Key terms: 	 Standard IciBemba, Rural Mambwe, Mutual Intelligibility, Linguistic 
Convergence, Semivocalisation, Coalescence, Vowel Harmony"
View of Examining Challenges that Affect the Implementation of the National Reading Programme by Teachers: A Case of Selected Schools in Malawi,Law,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/761/629,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/761/629,"Abstract
The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MoEST) in Malawi 
introduced the National Reading Programme (NRP) in 2015 to improve 
early grade learners’ literacy skills. However, results from the 2017 and 2018 
national reading assessment for Standard 2, Standard 4 and the NRP monitoring 
strategy revealed that the state of reading achievement was still below average. 
This study therefore examined challenges that affect the implementation of 
NRP by teachers. The study was qualitative in nature and was guided by the 
Social Constructivist Theory. Data was collected through semi-structured 
interviews with sixteen teachers, four head teachers, two Primary Education 
Advisors (PEAs) and one NRP Officer. Documentary analysis and classroom 
observations were done to triangulate data collected through interviews.
The study revealed that improvements in aspects of education systems  
including proper training and distribution of teachers, improved school 
infrastructure and community involvement, etc., are certainly necessary to 
achieve universal literacy. The study also suggested that it is only through 
everyone’s hard work and commitment that would ensure the realisation of  
the important goal of having all Malawian children be able to read and write.
The study is important because it provides a set of principles of learning 
about ideas and practices that promote learners’ academic achievement in 
reading and writing. Another anticipated value of the study is that it aggregates 
previous relevant studies on the problems surrounding the language curriculum 
implementation and synthesise the findings of previous studies."
View of “Sexing African Time and Space”: The Fetish of the Colonial Gender,Sociology,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/469/414,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/469/414,"Abstract
This article examines how Alain Mabanckou uses sexual allegories in his novel 
Broken glass (2010) to express (neo)-colonial realities in which Africa is charmed 
by the West into assuming the role of the sexual subaltern. Mabanckou appears 
to reinvigorate the sexual allegories of rape and prostitution for expressing the 
penetrative tendencies of colonialism by affixing their connotations of exploitation to 
the harsh socio-economic and political realities of (neo)-colonialism, thus creating 
a motif which is termed in the article as the fetish of colonial gender. Its coalescent 
value might be of great interest in postcolonial studies since it reveals how neo-
colonialists ascribe the subaltern’s time and space with exploitable sex through the 
charm of global economy. The critical discussion is built on textual research methods 
and it highlights on the fabric that holds the neo-colonial relationship between the 
West and Africa. 
Key words: colonial gender, (neo)-colonialism, sexed time and space."
View of Youth Conversion from Mainstream to Pentecostal Churches: A Case of Selected Churches in Matero and Emmasdale Townships in Lusaka District,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/468/413,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/468/413,"Abstract  
The study sought to investigate the reasons that led to youth conversion from mainstream 
to Pentecostal churches in Emmasdale and in the neighbourhood of Matero. The study was 
guided by Horton’s intellectualist theory of conversion in Africa. It used a case study design. 
The method of data collection included semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions 
and questionnaire. Findings of the study were that, there was automatic conversion taking 
place among the youths in mainstream churches to Pentecostalism. This was evident in all 
respondents in mega Pentecostal Church who had a mainstream background. Church leaders 
in mainstream churches were aware of youth converting to Pentecostal churches by accepting 
back the youths who had converted to a Pentecostal Church but had later made up their 
minds to go back. The study further revealed that non-Pentecostal parents supported and 
encouraged their children who converted to a mega Pentecostal Church owing to incentives 
such as; scholarships, employment and supportive programmes provided to their children. 
The study recommends that: sermon presentation should be revised in some mainstream 
churches. Explaining scriptures should not be exegetical only but linking scriptures to real life 
struggles of the youth. The church leaders in mainstream churches must formulate programmes 
that are more practical and youth oriented like charismatic prayer service, provision of 
scholarship, employment and positions of responsibilities through different ministries within 
the mainstream churches. Non-Pentecostal parents should not be too sceptical about children 
who associate themselves with Pentecostalism but encourage them to genuinely convert to 
this brand of Christianity.

View of Locative Inversion as an Alternation Phenomenon in Setswana: The Case of Lexical Functional Grammar Theory,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/467/405,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/467/405,"Abstract
The paper has examined locative inversion constructions in Setswana, showing that the 
pre-posed locative phrase in these constructions is not the subject as it is viewed by other 
linguists in the literature. It has been argued, in this paper, that locative phrase occurs in the 
sentence initial position to perform the topic function which sets the scene for the focused 
noun phrase that alternates with it (locative phrase).  The analysis has been achieved through 
information structure approach, showing the locative phrase that occurs in sentence initial 
position is a discourse phenomenon showing given information, and that the focused post-
verbal noun phrase is new information that is emphasised on.  Also, an appeal is made to 
Lexical Functional Grammar Approach to explain different ways of representing syntactic 
structures such as constituent structure and the functional structure.

View of The Cultural and Historical Significance of Kalanga Place Names in Midlands Province of Zimbabwe,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/470/416,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/470/416,"Abstract
The discipline of onomastics is still at its infancy yet it constitutes a very important aspect 
of the day to day survival of a people in the society. Naming is part of oral tradition in 
African societies, people were never used to write and record things but rather their names. 
This means that names are a historical record that would carry some aspects of a people’s 
way of life which include their history, beliefs and customs among others. On the same 
note, Midlands Province constitute of people from different backgrounds mainly Shona and 
Ndebele. Of interest to this research is the presence of the Kalanga people through some 
toponyms that are found in the area. In light of this view, this study therefore seeks to identify 
and unlock the culture and history embedded in these names by looking at the significance of 
Kalanga place names in Midlands Province. The study argues that place names or toponyms 
of any people carry with them a history, meaning and significance to particular people that 
name the places, thus studying the place names in this community can be a valuable tool of 
unpacking the history surrounding the Kalanga people in Midlands Province in Zimbabwe. 
Guided by the Afrocentric paradigm, specifically nommoic creativity tenant, the study seeks to 
explore the cultural and historical significance of Kalanga toponyms in Midlands Province."
View of Ideologically-based Polarisation and Racism in Discourse,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/382/350,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/382/350,"Abstract
“The privileged” against “the others”, “Us” against “Them”, “the Top” against “the Bottom” 
and “the Citizen” against “the Refugee/Immigrant”- are all ideologically-based discourses that 
classify human beings. The present study, being discourse analytical, aims to shed light on some 
discourses of polarization that are ideologically based and detect examples of such discourses in 
various fields as politics, science, sport and education. Methodological framework is based on 
Van Dijk’s models of ideological discourse analysis (2006a, 2006b &2007). Accordingly, a critical 
analysis of these discourses is applied in order to decode the meaning that lies deep within them, 
a meaning that reveals the deeply-rooted ideology that makes some believe that they deserve to be 
“the privileged” while other people are “the others” that are not privileged. Van Dijk’s model of 
ingroup-outgroup polarization (Emphasizing Our good things and Their bad things; Mitigating 
Our bad things and their good things) stands as a comprehensive/abstract standard that is to be 
detected in the data of this study. The paper concludes that the critical analysis of discourse has 
shown polarization/racism to be widespread in different fields of life. It calls for making changes 
in the way people think and conceive of “the others”- a first step towards a better socio-political 
atmosphere."
View of Personal Name Trends in Independent Zambia: A Reflection on the Fluidity of Living Heritage,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/381/347,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/381/347,"Abstract
Personal name usage in Zambia, as is common elsewhere, has undergone changes – 
reflecting the overall cultural and historical changes in the nation. This article identifies the 
changes which took place in personal naming patterns in Zambia since independence and 
discusses the wider socio-cultural and political factors which caused the changes in personal 
naming patterns in independent Zambia. The period after independence in 1964 represents 
a complex of various interacting histories of the nation, which have significantly impacted 
naming patterns. These include, transitions from mandatory requirement for adherents 
of the Roman Catholic Church and other Christian organisations to adopt baptismal 
names of European saints and enforcement, by school authorities, of usage of European 
first names by indigenous Northern Rhodesians during British colonial domination, to 
freedom to choose first names following political independence. Further developments 
include the closer mingling of local tribes/languages, the rise of charismatic churches, and 
Islam, among others. The methodology includes quantitative text analysis of the publicly 
available comprehensive University of Zambia (UNZA) graduate directory which contains 
names of all the institution’s graduates for the fifty-year period from its foundation in 1966 
to 2016. This work samples 2504 names extracted from the graduate directory between 
1976 and 2016 in ten-year-intervals as follows: 1976, 1986, 1996, 2006 and 2016. The 
highest institution of learning in Zambia is located in the capital, Lusaka. UNZA students 
are drawn from multi-ethnic backgrounds, mostly featuring Zambian language groups. The 
period under consideration includes both people who were born/named before and after 
independence. Other methods used in the context of the wider thesis were ethnographic 
field interviews with 23 respondents in Chongwe, Kafue and Lusaka districts, and personal 
communication with seven others by electronic means. Among the field respondents, four 
were aged between their mid-60s and 73, while the rest were of varying ages between 20 and 
52. The purposive selection criteria for the four elderly participants included age – those 
who had some experience of life under British colonial rule. The other group was randomly 
selected, observing balance in gender, socio-economic status and political views. The study 
confirms an increase in the usage of first names drawn from local languages. Over the study 
period, usage of indigenous Zambian personal names increased from 7.9 per cent to 31.6 per 
cent. The study also shows different generic patterns of first name usage among the different 
ethnic groups."
View of A Critical Review of Ideological Trends in the Study of Zambian Literature in English,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/386/349,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/386/349,"Abstract: 
Two ideologically divergent schools of thought have emerged in the study of Zambian 
literature in English. The first one rooted in imperialist doctrines emerged in the early 1980s 
and continues to influence many studies on Zambian literature to this day. The second one 
with a clear object of the renaissance of world literatures like that of Zambia is recent. 
It begun towards the end of the second decade of the 2000s and challenges the first one. 
This paper gives a critical discussion of studies that constitute and mark these two trends. 
It is a desktop research that employs the documental analysis informed by the historical 
cultural materialism theory. It concludes that the imperialist school of thought overlook 
and impoverish our understanding of the wider ideological and political context in which 
Zambian literature in English has and is evolving and the world literary scene on which we 
encounter it. Then, the renaissance school of thought does not just remedy this ideological 
problem but creates an opportunity for us to study Zambian literature in English as a distinct 
local realist tradition that is organically developing and in transition.

View of Inclusion or Exclusion? Critical Needs of Hearing Impaired Learners during an English Reading Comprehension Lesson,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/384/348,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/384/348,"Abstract
Drawing on the social inclusion theoretical model, this study examines critical needs of 
hearing impaired learners during an English reading comprehension lesson. Some of the 
challenges that hearing impaired learners experience arise due to their exclusion from 
activities, participation and access. The study utilised qualitative approaches through 
semi-structured interviews. A total of twenty-six participants from three secondary schools 
located in the northern region of Malawi participated in this study as follows: seven 
regular teachers, two specialist teachers, two resource persons and fifteen hearing impaired 
learners. The results reveal that most hearing impaired learners do not manage to attain all 
reading comprehension objectives. Although teachers use a combination of strategies during 
a reading comprehension lesson, they do not utilise strategies that promote higher-order 
cognitive thinking skills. Finally, the results reveal that hearing impaired learners encounter 
several challenges some of which may be avoided if teachers embrace inclusive practices. 
The results have implications for stakeholders, teachers and researchers as follows: there 
is a need to improve the inclusive system of education by providing in-service training for 
teachers and employing competent specialist teachers and resource persons to facilitate 
the learning of hearing impaired learners. There is also a need to improve the learning and 
teaching facilities for inclusive schools as teachers and learners bemoan lack of teaching 
and learning materials suitable for hearing impaired learners. Teachers would be able to 
overcome some of the barriers to participation and learning which arise due to inadequate 
teaching and learning resources. Further research should be carried out to check people’s 
understanding of the agenda of inclusive schools.

View of Eponymic Place Names in Zambia: A Critical Toponymies Perspective,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/442/394,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/442/394,"Abstract
This study examines eponymic place names in Zambia, specifically focusing 
on names of international airports and national stadia. Names of these 
features have been selected for study because in 2011, they had been 
subjected to changes. The study brings out the doubled nature of this name 
change by the Patriotic Front regime: to commemorate Zambia’s heroes 
and to entrench their political stamina. To successfully bring out the double 
edged nature of place name change by the Patriotic Front regime, the 
study engages Critical Toponymies Theory, a theory which considers place 
names as social artefacts which are caught up in a web of social conflict, 
implicating them as key players in (re)producing unequal socio-political 
power balance, an aspect which can be viewed as a social problem. The 
study argues that names of key national places or features in Zambia, 
banal and mundane as they may appear, are implicated in formulating and 
perpetuating social classes and power imbalance in the country because 
they are agents that promote the ideologies, aspirations and worldview of 
the ruling elites."
View of The Tonga Art of Kulibanda: A Literary and Linguistic Analysis,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/450/396,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/450/396,"Abstract
Framed within the broader context of two not so related theoretical lenses 
– literary theory and linguistic theory – the paper seeks to characterise 
Tonga practice of kulibanda as a language-based artistic expression for 
its sociocultural, literary and linguistic significance among the Tonga 
people. Couched within Austin’s speech act theory, Levison’s politeness 
principle and literary theory, this brief assessment attempts to bring into 
the spotlight unique characteristics of kulibanda, which in ordinary speech 
would be judged as flouting the maxims of politeness, deference and cultural 
appropriateness. Having considered the material potency of kulibanda 
collected from online platforms and occurring in real-life situation, it is 
insightful to conclude that the artistic clamour, stylistic flexibility and the 
linguistic sensibilities of kulibanda transform this piece of art beyond its 
traditional theoretical enclave of oral literature into the structured linguistic 
materiality for a shared sociocultural knowledge, histories and meaning 
making enterprise among the Tonga people."
View of Didactic Titles in Literature: A Look at Selected Zambian-Language Literary Works,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/448/397,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/448/397,"Abstract
This paper is a descriptive exploration of selected titles of Zambian-
language literary works that contain in them didactic aspects, that is, 
forms of general advisory statements and proverbs/sayings as actual titles 
of the particular books. It demonstrates that the use of proverbial titles 
makes these works of fiction more concerned with didacticism rather than 
entertainment. This moralistic disposition which apparently seems to be 
a trademark of many authors in Zambian languages is a manifestation of 
the influence of traditional African orature in general and Zambian oral 
cultures in particular which places emphasis on the teaching of moral values 
in storytelling. This paper is guided by two literary theoretical approaches 
namely: the sociological approach which posits that literature should act 
as a mirror of society as well as to provide solutions for the society; and 
the ethical approach especially the idea that art should be morally sound."
View of Exploring New Scientific Methods in the Teaching and Learning of Sesotho,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/452/399,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/452/399,"Abstract
Teaching and learning of languages especially modern languages, be they 
L1, L2 or L3, continue to evolve and shift from the traditional approach 
where the physical instructor was key to the educational process to 
contemporary interactive digital approaches that give the learn a certain 
amount of confidence and autonomy. However, this is not the case in Lesotho 
where the approach in the teaching and learning of Sesotho has arguably 
been traditional, despite the fact that Sesotho is not only the official 
language but also the only indigenous language spoken across the country. 
This article concerned with problems related to teaching and learning of 
Sesotho through the use of traditional methods. It argues that contemporary 
approaches would render the language much more accessible to the masses 
locally and internationally, particularly in the information age. Secondly, 
new methods would help re-document the language with all the indigenous 
knowledge and savoir-faire proper to the language and culture of Basotho. 
The article explores possible avenues of electronic language documentation 
and digitisation with the aim of improving the teaching and learning of 
Sesotho in formal academic establishments and in informal settings 
generally meant for foreign agents working or representing international 
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the rural areas of Lesotho. This 
is where citizens may know how to read and right but not be particularly 
conversant in the second official language - English. Finally, the article 
advocates for collaboration between computer scientists and linguists with 
the objective of developing an on-point Sesotho language software that 
supports regulated online language learning platforms."
"View of Affrication of Voiced Labials (/B, V/) in Changana",Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/447/398,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/447/398,"Abstract
This article describes and analyses the frication of the voiced labial 
consonants (/b/ and /v/) in Changana, a Bantu language (S53, in Guthrie’s 
1967-1971 classification). In the light of the autosegmental phonology (Leben 
1973, 1978, 2006; 1973, Goldsmith 1976, 2004; Odden 1986) combined with 
the Feature Geometry theory, the article discusses phonological processes 
that turn voiced labials into labial-alveolar affricate [bz]. In this study, we 
assume that the process of hiatus resolution by gliding is the trigger of the 
alteration under analysis. That is, when derivative suffixes with low vowel 
(/a/) and the high front vowel (/i/) in the initial position are attached to 
words with rounded vowels (/o, u/) in final position in some morphological 
processes such as diminutivisation and locativisation, the results are 
undesirable sequences (hiatus). In order to resolve such hiatus, a series 
of phonological processes such as the turning of the rounded vowel in the 
word final position into labial-velar glide allowing the adjacency of voiced 
labials with labial glide which violates the Obligatory Contour Principle 
(OCP) takes place.  The present study analyses the OCP using empirical 
Changana data collected both in the fieldwork supplemented by data from 
other sources including bibliographical and introspective data. The article 
is organised as follows. Firstly, it discusses the theoretical framework; 
secondly it analyses the Hiatus Resolution in Changana; thirdly, it analyses 
the data and lastly, it presents the main conclusions of the study."
View of An Exploratory Study of Language Use and Preferences among Nursing Lecturers and Students at Mzuzu University in Malawi,Law,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/454/401,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/454/401,"Abstract
This article reports on the insights gained from multilingual nursing 
lecturers and students at Mzuzu University in Malawi on the languages 
they use and prefer in a classroom setting. Research (Setati, Chitera and 
Essien, 2009; Chowdhury 2012) has found that both lecturers and students 
in multilingual and multicultural settings favour code-switching practices 
in the classroom setting. Code-switching is, therefore, an important 
phenomenon, which researchers should continue exploring because of 
the several distinctive attributes associated with it.  The study adheres to 
qualitative and quantitative designs through the use of a questionnaire 
and follow-up interviews as methods of data collection. The results reveal 
that both lecturers and students favour code-switching from English to 
Chichewa during lectures. From both lecturers’ and students’ perspectives, 
code-switching helps to translate and clarify difficult concepts. It also 
helps to prepare students for the nursing profession. The study has some 
practical and pedagogical implications. On the one hand, it contributes 
some meaningful insights for language planners and policy-makers; on 
the other hand, the study sheds important light on the need to include the 
workplace dimension during language in education and language planning 
conversations. This study is also important because it addresses the issue of 
how code-switching might effectively be exploited as a communicative and 
pedagogical resource in instruction."
View of Our Elders Never Lie: The Metaphor Power Base of Proverbs among the Tonga Speaking People of Zambia And Zimbabwe,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/444/400,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/444/400,"Abstract
This article seeks to explore ways through and extent to which the use 
of proverbs inspires confidence in the youth towards their elders in the 
African society in general and the Valley Tonga of Zambia and Zimbabwe 
in particular. The Achebean saying that ‘proverbs are the palm oil with 
which words are eaten,’ does not only point to the fact that proverbs make 
ordinary speech aesthetically pleasant to the ear but also that the wisdom 
contained therein is culturally/socially accepted.  The effective and efficient 
deployment of proverbs in this regard earns the user respect from targets 
of his address. The article analyses various ways in which proverbs are 
incorporated in everyday speech and how these in turn, enhance chances 
of delivering the intended message successfully among the Valley Tonga 
communicators. In most cases, when a Tonga speaker wishes to delegate 
presentation of a complex matter to the proverb, they attribute the wisdom 
to the Tonga society of yester years. This tendency, the article concludes, 
removes personalities from the proverb while promoting objective analysis 
of the situation by those addressed. The article examines selected proverbs 
in terms of structure, pattern of usage, types of images/metaphors used 
and their expected impact. The article applies a triangulation theoretical 
framework of Appraisal, Ethnopoetics and Afrocentricity theories to 
delineate the communicative intent of the proverber.  Together, the theories 
look at social functions of the language rendered by performers of the oral 
arts."

This paper is an initial attempt at trying to synthesise the state-of-art in 
the study on intonation in Bantu languages. The goal is to specifically 
investigate what central features emerge in the comparison of four 
Bantu languages to allow us to formulate a hypothesis on areal features 
and variation in Eastern Bantu languages. The base language used 
for the comparison is Bemba, for which details of local intonational 
effects such as final lowering in utterances, as well as global effects, 
such as pitch range expansion in questions, are provided. These same 
questions are compared and contrasted with findings in the literature on 
Chichewa, Tumbuka and Shingazidja. The results show that there are a 
number of areas of symmetry and areas of contrast, which allow us to 
begin to define features where we can expect parametric variation in 
Eastern Bantu languages."
View of A Discursive Analysis of Begging Discourse by the Visually Impaired in Zimbabwe,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/449/391,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/449/391,"Abstract 
The article seeks to explore the societal perceptions and interpretations of the 
discourse used by the visually impaired people when begging in Zimbabwe. 
The paper analyses the expression of words in speech and songs during the 
begging process. The study emerges out of the realisation that there is a high 
rate of people with visual impairment begging in streets and buses. These 
people use spoken discourse through singing and chanting when begging 
from the society. Despite the economic hardships in Zimbabwe, the visually 
impaired are always begging and highly active on a daily basis. It is against 
this realisation that the article focuses on how this discourse is perceived 
and interpreted by different people in Zimbabwean societies. The paper 
provides a socio linguistic analysis of the language used during begging 
by the visually impaired. The main focus is on the societal perceptions 
and interpretations of the discourse used by the visually impaired people 
when begging. The article uses a qualitative research methodology with  
purposive sampling technique employed to gather data from the passengers 
in buses, the visually impaired and their guides and from bus drivers and 
conductors. Random selection of some people was also done to get their 
perceptions and interpretations on the discourse by the visually impaired 
people in the streets. Guided by the critical discourse analysis theory, the 
paper argues that the discourse used by the visually impaired is largely 
‘politicised’ so as to appeal to people’s minds and get the assistance they 
need."

Francis Moto is a Malawian writer who has published poetry both in 
vernacular (Chichewa) and in English. His poetry in English appears in 
a collection titled Gazing at the Setting Sun published in 1994, the year 
Malawians voted Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda and his Malawi Congress 
Party (MCP) out of power. Besides recording the suffering of Malawians 
during the autocratic leadership of the first post-independence president, 
Dr Banda, and remembering the author’s childhood experiences, the poetry 
also celebrates Malawi’s political transformation from one party rule to 
multiparty democracy in the early 1990s. In the poems, Moto also looks to 
the future with a sense of hope for a better society where human rights and 
the rule of law will be respected. This article analyses Moto’s poems with 
the aim of celebrating his successes as a poet. This is done by focusing on 
his more successful poems in terms of style. It is argued in this article that 
the success of some of Moto’s poems in Gazing at the Setting Sun depends 
on his allusions to and evocations of dictatorship and political change in 
Malawi. These evocations and allusions depend on his imagery and choice 
of words and expressions. In the analysis of the poems, close reading with 
a particular focus on style is done. The discussion is in two parts. The first 
part discusses Moto’s poems that allude to the dictatorial reign of Dr Banda 
in Malawi and the second part provides a discussion of Moto’s imagery in 
relation to his evocation of political change."
View of VN Phrasal Compounds in Cinyanja,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/453/393,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/453/393,"Abstract
This article aims at discussing verb-noun compounds with a locative prefix 
in the nominal part of the compounds in Cinyanja. The singular and plural 
forms of the compounds have been presented to show that the complex 
forms are nouns. With regard to the internal structure, the compounds 
show that they have a phrasal structure. Since verb-noun compounds in 
this study resemble the structure of synthetic compounds in English, the 
analysis of these words followed the syntactic approach. The results show 
that internally, the compounds with a locative have a verb phrase internal 
structure, and follow the verb-argument word order. In the syntactic 
context, it is shown that the compounds with the phrasal internal structure 
function as determiner phrases because they can appear in the subject and 
object positions in simple sentences and relative clauses. Further, the entire 
compound word can be modified by adjectives, and be coordinated with 
simple nouns, which suggests that the compounds with a locative are indeed 
determiner phrases. Finally, with the application of the lexical integrity 
hypothesis, the results reveal that the compounds with the locative in the 
nominal part are genuine compounds because they adhere to the lexical 
integrity principle."
View of The Robotic Man by Habit: An Existential Analysis of Albert Camus’ The Misunderstanding,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/445/395,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/445/395,"Abstract
Human existence is essentially characterised by habit. It is habit that 
carries us most of the times, from one day to another as our daily activities 
are mostly routine in nature. As Albert Camus (1942) notes, most of our 
daily activities are commanded by habit. This is why Camus compares the 
human condition to that of Sisyphus. Camus submits that like Sisyphus, the 
same rhythm carries us from one day to another and this makes our actions 
automatic, if not robotic. Furthermore, Camus notes that habit usually 
leads to monotony, boredom and meaninglessness of our actions. This is 
what he refers to as the absurdity of human existence; a feeling of futility we 
may experience when we become aware of the repetitiveness of our routines 
and rituals (Craig, 2005); grosso modo, a lack of fundamental meaning 
in life. In this paper, our analysis of Camus’ play, ‘The Misunderstanding’ 
(1943) is hinged upon Sartre’s existentialism, which has close affinities with 
Camus’ philosophical concept of the absurd. In ‘Being and Nothingness’ 
(1943), Sartre submits that the problem of being is the most important 
phenomenological problem. According to Sartre, there are  essentially, two 
modes of existence; Being-in-itself and Being-for-itself. Being-in-itself is 
the type of being that objects in this world have; for example, Being-for-
itself is the being of human beings. In this article, we have submitted that 
habit robotises the characters in Camus’ play in that it (habit) transforms 
them into Being-in-itself whose existence is passive and absurd."

View of Teacher Preparedness to Utilize Emergent Literacy for Teaching Initial Literacy in Selected Schools of Mansa District,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/393/351,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/393/351,"ABSTRACT 
Effective teaching of initial literacy in Grade 1 demands more of the teacher’s attention to 
pupils’ emergent literacy skills and consideration of how they learn. The emergent literacy 
skills children acquire lay a firm foundation for their learning to read and write in the 
conventional sense. Some of the skills that children develop under emergent literacy 
include phonological awareness and phonological sensitivity, which give children the 
ability to hear, recognize, manipulate and distinguish the sounds of the language they have 
acquired. These are key language skills which teachers will need to utilize in their teaching 
of reading and writing skills to Grade 1 learners in the classroom.  
A study was carried out whose purpose was to investigate whether primary school teachers 
in Mansa District utilized emergent literacy skills in their teaching of conventional reading 
and writing skills to the learners in Grade 1 considering the fact that emergent literacy lays 
a firm and solid foundation for continuous development of the literacy skills. The study 
was a descriptive survey and qualitative in nature since it required the researcher to 
describe the state of affairs as found and observed in their natural setting in the research 
sites. The qualitative methods of data collection and analysis were used. The sample for 
this study comprised 62 Grade 1 teachers and 3,594 Grade 1 primary school pupils. Only 
those schools teaching initial literacy in the local familiar language using the Breakthrough 
to Literacy (BTL) methodology were targeted for this research.  
The findings indicated that: (1) Teachers lacked knowledge about emergent literacy and 
did not know how useful it was for continuous literacy development among the children. 
(2) Most of the teachers ignored pupils’ prior literacy knowledge and considered their 
learners as complete illiterates who knew nothing about literacy skills. (3) Teachers never 
designed extra teaching and learning materials for teaching literacy. Rather, they relied on 
the New Breakthrough to Literacy (NBTL) kit materials. (4) The class sizes were large and 
meaningful scaffolding was lacking in most of the classes.  
This study concluded that the Ministry of Education in Zambia should consider emergent 
literacy as the foundation for conventional literacy development in Grade 1. One 
recommendation was that teachers should be equipped with knowledge of emergent 
literacy through deliberate training. They need to understand and appreciate emergent 
literacy as an essential body of knowledge to be utilized  for successful conventional 
literacy development among Grade 1 learners."

View of Legal Societal System Intervention Trauma to Child Sexual Abuse Victims Following Disclosure in the Lusaka Urban District of Zambia,Law,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/365/329,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/365/329,"ABSTRACT
The rigorous hospital, police and legal procedures through which sexually abused 
children go through can further increase the level of trauma if not done professionally. 
If these procedures are performed in a sensitive and knowledgeable manner this can 
lead to an expedited healing process for the child who is sexually traumatised.  Trauma 
is not just a health hazard but a condition that can impair full disclosure of required 
details by a child who has been sexually abused.
In Phase 1, four in-depth case studies of children who were sexually abused were 
carried out using the qualitative method of one to one oral interviews.  Phase II 
involved an investigation into the relationship between societal interventions such 
as court procedures and trauma levels in fifty sexually abused children.  The tool that 
was used to assess or to measure the level of trauma and determine the amount of 
stress experienced by each child was the Trauma Symptoms Checklist for children. 
This instrument was developed by John Biere (1989).  The data obtained was analysed 
using descriptive analysis.
The police officers, the social workers and health workers indicated that they 
had interviewed  50 per cent of the sexually abused children three times while the 
remaining 10 per cent reported to have been interviewed more than three times.  It 
was further reported that each child had an average of three cross examinations in the 
courts of law.  The Trauma Symptoms Check List revealed that twenty five (50%) 
of sexually abused children who had been separated from their primary care-givers 
exhibited more stress and trauma than their counterparts.  It was also found that fifteen 
of the sexually abused children who were taken to the juvenile courts of law exhibited 
less stress and trauma than their colleagues who were taken to the regular adult courts. 
It was also observed that 75 per cent of the sexually abused children who indicated 
that they had trusting relationships with the professionals expressed being at ease with 
them.
This study indicates that certain types of societal system interventions such 
as multiple questioning, more than three interviews, child-mother or care-giver 
separation, inadequate trust during the investigation, court procedures and social 
service phases, further traumatised sexually abused children.
Key words: Trauma, Societal Interventions, Sexual Abuse Disclosure."
View of Factors Affecting Use of the Female Condom Among Sexually Active Women in Chongwe District: A Case of Chongwe and Kanakantapa Wards,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/362/345,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/362/345,"ABSTRACT
The purpose of this study is to investigate and bring out the factors that affect use 
of the female condom among sexually active women in Chongwe District. The 
female condom even though widely publicised still remains the least used method 
of contraception. Based on the 2007 Demographic and Health Survey Statistics, in 
Zambia alone, use only counts for an alarming 2 per cent of the total women population 
(Demographic & Health Survey 2007). This highlights the fact that use among women 
is very low and this article investigates why use is low. 
The study establishes what factors affect use and the study takes place in Chongwe 
District which provides a fair and general representation of the country’s population. 
Both qualitative and quantitative approaches were used for the present study. 
A Descriptive case study method was employed in the study. This method was used 
because it looks at individuals, groups, institutions, methods and materials in order to 
describe, compare, contrast, classify, analyse and interpret the entities and the events 
that constitute their various fields of enquiry. A sample of 250 Chongwe residents 
both male and female was selected from both Chongwe and Kanakantapa Wards. 
A Cluster sampling method was employed to select the two Wards Chongwe and 
Kanakantapa.  A list was obtained from organisations (markets, schools, hospitals, 
council and police) and a sampling frame created. Simple random technique was used 
to select the total sample of 250 residents.
Questionnaires and interviews were used to collect the data. This method is 
appropriate and used because it enables the researcher avoid biases in collecting 
data and to have a full picture of what is really happening concerning the activities 
surrounding the use of the female condom. 
The results show that attitudes, perceived barriers, knowledge and male partner 
influence all have an effect on female condom use. It was also found that attitudes 
towards female condom use were very poor in Chongwe district. The majority 
(46.7%) were not interested in the female condom at all with only (20%) showing 
interest and (33.3%) not sure whether or not they liked it or accepted it. The response 
on knowledge on the other hand was very positive with 70 per cent claiming to have 
knowledge of the female condom and only 30 per cent having no idea at all. This 
result proves that knowledge of the female condom still remains high."
View of Girl Child Sexual Abuse in Lusaka Urban,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/366/331,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/366/331,"ABSTRACT
The study on girl child sexual abuse and whose findings are presented in this article 
was conducted in 2010 as an academic requirement for the purpose of completing a 
Master’s degree in Gender Studies at the University of Zambia.
This article outlines issues of sexual abuse and the various reasons why under-age 
girls are more vulnerable to sexual abuse, cultural beliefs with regard to sexual abuse, 
gender and power relations and sexual abuse, and existing community programmes and 
knowledge levels, and institutional mechanisms of the sexual abuse case reporting in 
Lusaka urban. The article has drawn conclusions and recommendations for enhancing 
the protection of the children against child sexual abuse. By conducting a study that 
comprehensively assesses the types of programmes and perceived implementation 
gaps from Lusaka, this report poses specific policy and structural recommendations 
on how best to address the existing problem of increased vulnerability of under-age 
girls to sexual abuse.  
Child sexual abuse is a form of abuse in which a child is abused for the sexual 
gratification of an adult or older adolescent (CHIN, 2005: 53). Child sexual abuse is 
the actual or the likely sexual exploitation of a child and includes rape, incest and all 
forms of sexual activity (VSO, 2008: 2). In Zambia, anyone under the age of sixteen 
is classified as a child. 
Researchers cite various reasons why child sexual abuse is so common: Gender 
power relations (patriarchy views which place women and children in lower positions), 
poverty, a legacy of violent homes, power relations between children and adults, and 
cultural beliefs.
The research was an exploratory study undertaken in Lusaka urban and endeavored 
to explore why the problem of sexual abuse was persistent and why under-age children 
were vulnerable to it. Using purposive and simple random sampling, a sample size of 
seventy was arrived at and both qualitative and quantitative approaches of research 
were employed. The data was then analysed manually and by Statistical Package for 
Social Science (SPSS).  
The institutions visited were: Ministry of Community Development and Social 
Welfare, Women and Law in Southern Africa Trust, The Child Protection Unit of 
the Zambia Police Service, Young Women Christian Association, Isubilo Orphanage 
and Drop-in Centre and Jesus Cares Ministries Orphanage. Additionally, community 
members from Chawama, Mtendere and Kabwata compounds were interviewed for 
more insight into the study."
View of An Ethical Investigation into the Impact of Mophane Worm Depletion on the Environment in the North-Eastern Part of Botswana: A Case Study of Gungwe and Mbalambi Villages,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/372/327,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/372/327,"ABSTRACT
Mophane worm is a name given to caterpillars hosted by the Mophane tree. The 
mophane worm is harvested as food supplement in most of the Southern African 
countries. For the past few years, there have been some reports indicating that the 
worm has disappeared in some parts of Botswana. Hence, the aim of this research 
study has been to investigate from an ethical perspective the impact of mophane 
worm depletion on the environment. A qualitative approach was used in this study 
and data was collected from the following target groups of people: villagers, headmen 
of the stated two villages and the Ministry of Environment, Wildlife and Tourism 
(MEWT) officers both at local and national level. The theoretical framework involved 
traditional theories (i.e., Value Theory and Utilitarianism) and environmental ethical 
theories (i.e., Social Ecology, Environmental and Intergenerational Justice).
The research instruments employed were individual interview schedules, focus 
group discussions and observation. A fourfold model of analysis was used focusing 
on the biological, economical, social and political dimensions. From the findings 
of the study, it emerged that both natural and anthropogenic factors contributed to 
mophane worm depletion. The natural factors were drought and predation while the 
anthropogenic factors included massive usage of the host tree, destructive methods of 
harvesting and demand for more land for agricultural and residential purposes. It also 
emerged that mophane worm depletion had both negative and positive impacts on 
the environment. These included lack of money by the local people to buy their daily 
needs, lack of relish and poor livelihoods, loss of wildlife that fed on mophane worm 
and tension between government and local people over the regulation of the resource. 
Ethical evaluation revealed that the dominant value for the local people  was utility 
value to the almost total lack of explicit awareness of intrinsic and inherent value, 
and that on utilitarian grounds, the overall evil that depletion of the mophane worm 
brought about outweighed its overall good effects. With regard to justice issues, the 
findings revealed that unjust social structures and injustices resulting from the unequal 
distribution of benefits and burdens as well as from the lack of adequate participation 
by the local communities in decision-making had a greater negative than positive 
impact. Finally, recommendations were made emphasising the utmost importance of 
government intervention to mitigate, if not, stop the depletion of the mophane worm."
View of Challenges faced by Women With Visual Impairment in Living a Sustainable Livelihood,Development Studies,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/373/326,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/373/326,"ABSTRACT
The nature of the challenges faced by women with visual impairments remains 
uncertain. However, studies have been done on women with disabilities in general but 
none has focused on women with visual impairments. This study sought to establish 
the challenges faced by women with visual impairments in living a sustainable 
livelihood in urban areas.
A descriptive survey design was used in order to obtain a true and comprehensive 
picture of individuality. Primary data was collected through interview schedules and 
questionnaires.
Data was collected from women with visual impairments in selected government 
line ministries. For those not in employments, data was collected from the central 
business district where they parade to ask for alms from well wishers.
The target sample was all women with visual impairments registered with the 
Federation for the Blind and based in Lusaka urban. Stratified sampling was used to 
classify women with visual impairments into their economic status such as those in 
formal employment and those not working at all.
Sixteen (50%) of women with visual impairments were in formal employment 
while sixteen (50%) were on the street begging. Twenty-one (66%) of the women with 
visual impairment revealed that they were not able to live a sustainable livelihood 
due to the different challenges they faced while eleven (44%) stressed that they were 
managing because they had a salary though it was not enough to cater for their basic 
needs. From the findings it has been noted that women with visual impairments have 
a lot of challenges on sustainable livelihood. Sixty-six (66%) of the women stated 
that they were not able to live a sustainable livelihood, as most of them depended on 
begging for their livelihood. The money they realised from begging could not meet 
all their basic needs. The findings also reveal that the women with visual impairments 
despite their level of education, could not be offered any other job apart from being 
telephone operators. From the sixteen (50%) of women with visual impairments who 
are in formal employment, eleven (69%) had attained grade nine while five (31%) 
were grade twelve  school leavers and yet they were doing the same job. The grade 
twelve school leavers felt unfairly treated because sight had disadvantaged them in 
the area of wanting to do other professions of their dreams. Further, it was found that 
there were some cultural factors that contribute to the challenges women with visual 
impairments face. In as much as they know that they have no sight, they feel they must 
be appreciated as human beings just like the women with sight. The findings show that"
"View of Risk Factors and Child Sexual Abuse among High School Pupils in Lusaka District, Zambia",Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/361/344,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/361/344,"ABSTRACT
Child sexual abuse is a universal problem that affects both boys and girls. In Zambia, 
like many other African countries, there are certain conditions and circumstances 
that put children at risk of sexual abuse. However, these risk factors remain explored 
(Chiroro et al., 2006). This study, therefore, was aimed at investigating risk factors and 
exploring child sexual abuse in Lusaka District. Specifically, it focused on identifying 
the forms of sexual abuse; examine the factors that put children at risk for sexual 
abuse; find out the grooming tactics used by sexual abusers; find out the disclosure 
rate for child sexual abuse cases; examine the abuser-victim relationships; and make 
recommendations for child sexual abuse prevention. Participants were 200 secondary 
school pupils (86 males and 114 females), who were randomly selected. Their ages 
ranged from sixteen to twenty-one years. Data was collected using a structured self-
report questionnaire and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs). Data analysis was done 
using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).  
The results show an overall prevalence rate of child sexual abuse to be 43.5 per cent 
(n=87). Of the 87 victims, 41.1 per cent (n=36) were males and 58.6 per cent (n=51) 
were females. Among the forms of sexual abuse, sexual touch/arousal had the highest 
frequency (n=54, 62.1%). Most of the subjects (75.6%, n=19) did not disclose their 
sexual experiences, whereas only 24.4 per cent (n=19) did. Most abusers were found 
to be family members (n=39, 44%). 
Six risk factors for sexual abuse were examined, and the most powerful one was 
parental absence (n=63, 73.3%); having punitive parents (n=57, 68.7%); alcohol 
intake by a parent or other guardian (n=30, 34.5%); poor parent-child relationship 
(n=20, 23.7%); parental conflict (n=19, 22.4%); and presence of a stepparent (n=13, 
13.1%).  
Furthermore, the results obtained from the FGDs show that the most frequently used 
trick for sexual abuse is the offer of money and/other gifts (n=21, 67.8%). Fifty-six 
(69%) of the victims lacked knowledge to know that the grooming they experienced 
would result into sexual abuse. The study tested two hypotheses: 
(a) 	alcohol intake by the parent or guardian is not a significant risk factor for child 
sexual abuse; 
(b) in Lusaka District, children and adolescents that are sexually abused have 
adequate knowledge of the grooming tactics used by abusers. 
The results showed that:"

Successful environmental communication is achieved through a well informed public 
as it will be better equipped and positioned to tackle environmental challenges of the 
21st Century. A well informed public is partly a result of the role the media plays in 
disseminating information. Hence the media play a strategic role in raising public 
environmental awareness, dissemination of environmental information and inspiring 
environmental action. This study looked at the role of the Zambian media in public 
environmental awareness and education.
The study aimed at finding out the role of the Zambian media in public environmental

View of Teacher Educators’ Perceptions of Environmental Education As a Crosscutting Issue and Their Participation in Its Teaching at Kitwe and Mansa Colleges of Education,Unclassified,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/368/325,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/368/325,"ABSTRACT
This study was undertaken to investigate the respondents’ perceptions of Environmental 
Education (EE) and participation in its teaching at Kitwe and Mansa Colleges of Education 
in Zambia. The study used both qualitative and quantitative research approaches which 
also included questionnaires, observations and focus group discussions as research 
instruments. Content analysis was used to ascertain teacher educators’ participation in 
EE. A sample comprised thirty-three purposively selected college teacher educators. 
The data collected was analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively.
The findings revealed that respondents’ views of EE were associated with creation 
of awareness about the environment and narrowly viewed EE in terms of nature 
conservation. The majority (73%) of the respondents stated that EE was wrongly 
included in the curriculum. The study further revealed that EE was only taught as 
topics or subtopics in Science Education (SE), Social, Spiritual and Moral Education 
(SSME) and Technology Studies (TS) and not as a crosscutting discipline across the 
curriculum; and that teacher educators essentially adopted teacher-centred methods 
in teaching EE, concentrating on imparting book-based knowledge. Moreover, no 
mechanism existed to compel them to integrate EE in lessons taught making the 
crosscutting approach ineffective in implementing it.
The majority of the respondents had neither received pre-service nor in-service 
training in EE and if they had received such training, it was irrelevant to the work they 
were doing. The study concluded that EE should not end at the creation of awareness 
about the environment but should be linked to knowledge, skills and attitudes required 
to demand for an action for the environment. The recommendations made were that 
the curriculum should be reviewed and EE topics or content also be incorporated in all 
study areas. In addition, the Ministry of Education (MoE) through Teacher Education 
and Specialised Services (TESS) should formulate a policy framework to guide 
EE teaching in Primary Colleges of Education. In fact, the EE should formulate or 
contribute questions toward final examinations and the Ministry of Education (MoE) 
should procure EE teaching resources. Additionally, teacher educators should use 
extra curricular activities as learning space for EE.
Lastly,  colleges should appoint EE Coordinators to spearhead the EE implementation. 
There is an urgent need to train or reorient teacher educators in the two colleges on 
how they could strengthen the grounding in EE. When such training is concluded 
well, it should now cover all the Zambian Colleges of Education."
View of Relevance of Education for Sustainable Development to Zambian High School Geography: A Survey of High Schools in Lusaka City,Development Studies,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/369/324,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/369/324,"ABSTRACT
Geography is one of the subjects offered in all high schools in Zambia. At the time this 
study was conducted in the year 2010, five years after the declaration of the Decade 
of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) (2005-2014), ESD had not yet been 
incorporated at high school level. The study hence sought to determine the aspects 
of Geography that were compatible with ESD to ascertain the attitude of high school 
pupils towards Geography and determine ways in which the Geography syllabus 
could be improved vis-à-vis the need for pupils to be empowered to thrive in their 
local environments. A descriptive survey research design was used and information 
was gathered through group discussions (for the pupils) and questionnaires (for the 
pupils and Geography Heads of Section). The study found that ESD could make a 
contribution to Geography in the areas of field projects, personal hygiene and health, 
sexual education, intergenerational transmission of knowledge, use of indigenous 
knowledge and localisation of the Geography syllabus. The study found that though 
pupils were interested in Geography as reflected by their general good performance in 
examinations, nonetheless negative attitudes existed towards Geography because of 
its detachment from pupils’ personal environments, excessive use of teacher-centred 
methods and the bulky nature of the Geography syllabus."
View of Proposed Synergies between Indigenous and Modern Systems of Environmental Education in Addressing Development Planning in Zambia,Development Studies,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/view/367/328,https://journals.unza.zm/index.php/JLSS/article/download/367/328,"ABSTRACT
The study drew inspiration from the need to counteract the ensuing failures of 
modern systems in addressing development challenges especially at local level 
despite several efforts by government to invest resources in poverty reduction 
and general developmental interventions. The study identified the alienation of 
indigenous knowledge systems in the mainstream modern systems of Environmental 
Education (EE) and development planning as a compounding problem that accounted 
for development stagnation in the communities. This alienation created the gap in 
knowledge since modern systems were generally found to be inadequate in addressing 
developmental issues, particularly at a local level. The lack of local relevance of most 
modern systems justified the call for integration of indigenous systems.
The study focused on the need to establish linkages between the modern and 
indigenous systems of environmental education and their influence on development 
planning in Zambia.  In so doing, the study proposed an approach to remedy the 
alienation of indigenous systems in the mainstream processes of EE and development 
planning by suggesting a synergy between the two systems.  The study involved 
an assessment of some inherent policies, strategies, processes, methodologies and 
perceptions about EE and development planning. It, therefore, largely dealt with non-
concrete ideas to which the reader is introduced.  This point is crucial in appreciating 
the main orientation of the study.
Descriptive research design was applied with qualitative approaches. The respondents 
were purposively sampled and included government officers and other modern experts, 
NGOs, and traditional leaders.  A comparative analysis of modern systems was further 
made through a global dimension where the Zambian modern system and that of 
selected foreign countries, Germany and Montenegro were reviewed. 
The study established that the approaches applied in environmental education and 
general nature conservation were related to the country’s guiding principles which also 
reflected the overall vision, where it existed. Furthermore, a number of environmental 
policy instruments were examined and the following were identified as the main 
instruments:
•	 Direct regulation
•	 Indirect regulation
•	 Self-regulation, and 
•	 A combination of the above instruments."
